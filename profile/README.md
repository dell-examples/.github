# Welcome to Dell Examples

Dell welcomes contributions to any and all repositories within this GitHub Org, whether or not you work for Dell. Contributions may be:

* Improvements to or fixes for existing example code

* Updates to example documentation

* Complete example code for a use case not currently included

Please note that pull requests that contribute new example code or update existing sample code in a way that affects usage should include documentation.

If you are a Dell employee and would like to contribute a new repository or a repository currently under your control, reach out to one of the org admins: [Kat Cosgrove](https://github.com/katcosgrove) and [Ryan Wallner](https://github.com/wallnerryan).

## Getting Started

### **Create a new repository within the dell-examples org.**

1. _Does your example repo fit within dell-examples?_

    Code within dell-examples must use the MIT License. In a nutshell, the example repos can be used for whatever anyone wants as long as they include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source. 

    If so, great! Move on to step 2.

2. _Create a new repository for your project._

    Reach out to the org admins: [Kat Cosgrove](https://github.com/katcosgrove) and [Ryan Wallner](https://github.com/wallnerryan) or create a [New Repo Request discussion](https://github.com/orgs/dell-examples/discussions/categories/new-repo-requests). Provide a breif description of the project along with a list GitHub usernames that will need access to the repository as well as a name for the repository.

3. _Push your contributions and provide docs!_

    It is important for all projects who have adequate documentation on its usage and how to contribute.

### **Modify an existing dell-examples repository.**

1. _Find the project_

    Head to https://github.com/orgs/dell-examples/repositories and navigate to the landing page.

    Read through `CONTRIBUTING.md` within the root of the project.

### **Ask Questions**
